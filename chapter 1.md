In the main method, we could:
  1. do something;
    statements: declarations, assignments, method calls;
  2. do something again and again;
    loops: for and while;
  3. do something under this condition;
    branching: if/else tests;

syntax:
statement must end in a semicolon;
//single line comment begins with two forward slashes;
most white space doesn't matter;
declare variables with a name and a type;
class and method must be defined within a pair of curly braces {}

java is oop, most stuff in java are objects;
a program only need one main;
